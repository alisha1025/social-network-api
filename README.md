# Social Network API

## Description

This is a RESTful API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. The API is built using **Express.js** for routing, **MongoDB** as the NoSQL database, and **Mongoose** as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool. This API can handle large amounts of unstructured data, making it scalable for social media platforms.
